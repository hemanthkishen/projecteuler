#1/x + 1/y = 1/n
#using algebra, we solve for y in terms of x and n
# y = nx/(x-n)
# let d = (x-n)
# y = nx/d
# x = d+n
# y = n(d+n) / d
# y = (nd + n^2)/d
# y = n + n^2/d
# so for y to be integer, we need to find divisors d of n^2
# then backsubstitute
# x, y (with the constraints that n < x <= 2n)

# The number of solutions for num is (divisors(n^2)+1)/2
